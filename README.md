# Retro Deck

*A programmable 8-key macro pad built on a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/?variant=raspberry-pi-pico-w) with [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/).*

### Credit where credit is due
I only adapted these designs. The real credit goes to the following people, without whom this project would not have been possible:
- Based on DaveM's [Stream Cheap](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2822140), the retro deck adds a slot for a screen mount to be inserted and uses a Pico instead of an Arduino Pro Micro. Dave outlines the steps to build a stream cheap [on his website](https://www.partsnotincluded.com/diy-stream-deck-mini-macro-keyboard/).
- The [Monitor](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3548757) was designed by TucksProjects.

## Goals I had for this project
- 3D print 8 key macro pad
- long press a key to activate a profile
- short press a key to activate the macro
- display current mode and last macro run on screen

## A very quick Q&A
- **Why did you use a Pico instead of an Arduino Pro Micro?**
  - I like Raspberry Pi's, hadn't used a Pico yet, and had $6. I also wanted to try out CircuitPython.
- **Can it launch apps?**
  - If you can launch it with a keyboard shortcut, then yes*.
  - *I haven't tried though. I'm primarily using it to with keyboard shortcuts that are more complicated than I want to remember.
- **Can I use it to play games?**
  - Sure, I guess. I haven't tried it yet. I imagine you'll have some ghosted keys, as this codebase is not rock solid (yet).
- **Your code is shit.**
  - I know. I'm working on it. Please contribute by starting [a feature request](https://github.com/russell-davis/Retro-Deck/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) to make it better

# Configuration

### mappings.json
The easiest way to get started configuring your Retro Deck is to duplicate and rename the `example-mappings.json` copy to `mappings.json` and edit it to represent your wiring.
